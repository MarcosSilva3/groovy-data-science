# Deep-learning with DJL and Apache MXNet

Neural networks with numerous layers of nodes allow for more complex, rich and _deeper_ processing and understanding.
This example detects objects within an image.
It uses a pre-trained model and the
[Deep Java Library](https://djl.ai/) backed by the
[Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) engine.

![MXNet.groovy](../../docs/images/mxnet.png)

Groovy code examples can be found in the [DeepLearningMxnet](subprojects/DeepLearningMxnet/src/main/groovy) subproject.
If you have opened the repo in IntelliJ (or your favourite IDE) you should be able to execute the examples directly in the IDE.

__Requirements__: The code has been tested on JDK8, JDK11 and JDK17.
